## How to add Gifs to Your PR
If you’re a contributor, you might be wondering, “What’s the easiest way to add a gif?” 
I use the GIFs for ![GIFs for Github](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gifs-for-github/dkgjnpbipbdaoaadbdhpiokaemhlphep/related?hl=en) chrome extension. 
Once it’s installed, you’ve got a quick way to add all your favorite gifs to enhance that PR experience. 
Just search for the gif you want, and click it. You can even add a caption to describe the gif or explain how it relates to the PR 👏
